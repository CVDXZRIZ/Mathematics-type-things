Just funsies to understand the fundamentals, or atleast the calculations of mathematical expressions. 
Much helps are apreciated and really I'm nothing without mathematics irl. 
Simply copy and use straight from the terminal. 
I'm no designer by any means, but I do hope to someday be able to make an actual app with visualisations someday. 


Here's the contents list of the projects:

Logarithm: Includes the natural log only for now, i'll try to make the base customisable next. 
Includes declaration of the ln function.

Sine trig: Surprisingly accurate for whole numbers, with a minimal error for rational numbers.
Includes Factorial function declaration.
